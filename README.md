Data visualization of Chennai rainfall data.
Here is the data visualization of Chennai water management data which is available at kaggle.
In this Dataset ,the data of four regions reservoir rainfall and rainfall level from 2004 to 2019 is given.
From this data,we get to know how the rainfall level change in these years and how much rainfall receive by the region.
With the evaluation of data,the rainfall level in the year 2019 is very low and the consumption occur from the water receive in 2018.
So the good rainfall must have to be receive by the region to fulfill the demand,otherwise the solution have to be made to fulfill the demands.
Also from the visualization,we get to know the rainfall mostly occur or receive in the month from September to January.
Due to continuous consumption of water after rainfall the level is decrease over the months and is very low in July and  August.
